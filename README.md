## Dataset Preparation


**You can find the data for the DG benchmark [here](https://pan.quark.cn/s/981b7072139a).**


### Cross-Working Condition

For example:

```python
CWRUTasksetting = {
    'dataset': 'C-CWRU', 
    'class_num': 10, 
    'src_tar': np.array([[0, 1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 3, 2], [0, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 3, 0]])
}
```

In the C-CWRU dataset, there are four working conditions (0, 1, 2, 3) with 10 types of healthy vibration data. Four tasks are created by selecting one condition as the target domain and the other three as the source domains.

### Cross-Machine Condition

For example:

```python
datasetlist = [['M_CWRU', 'M_IMS', 'M_JNU', 'M_HUST']]
```

This indicates using data from CWRU, IMS, and JNU as source domains (combining all working conditions) and the HUST dataset as the target domain (also combining all working conditions).
